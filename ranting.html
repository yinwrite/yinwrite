            When you are considered a generally trusted person who won't go "snitch", people tend to tell you things. When I see someone is upset, I ask them what is wrong, and they usually spill some deep shit right on my lap. I let them, and I welcome them to do so as I do my best to let them rant and provide the best words I am capable of.
            <br><br>
            This tends to happen most with acquaintances, as there’s just some inherit safety in ranting to a person you have some basis of trusting, but know you aren’t stuck facing judgement from ever again if you chose to just not talk to them (and since you’re just acquaintances, no one is hurt if you do so).
            <br><br>
            This in itself lets me in on intimate pieces of the lives of people I’ve never met.

            When it happens with friends, it tends to be because they know I don’t judge. Honestly, you could have a hardcore toe/foot fetish Instagram page and I wouldn’t judge you, as I’ve done my FAIR share of “bad” things, too.
            <br><br>
            I think everyone deserves at least 1 safe person to talk to about the things they would normally receive general social consequence for.
            <br><br>
            <b><i>Just to be clear, none of these things will be shared with ANY form of identifying information. That is simply wrong of me.</b></i>
            <br><br>
            To date, I know the stories of at <i>least</i> 8 current/former north students off the top of my head who have been sexually assaulted/raped and who did it to them. The number jumps to 15-20 if you count non-north high students. I know of at least 5 north kids who have been physically abused by parental figures.
            <br><br>
            To be clear once more, these stories are never shared. Not to friends of that person, not to my significant other, my therapist, etc.

            That’s rather depressing, though, so let’s continue. On top of depressing things, I also know some funny things. I know the size of too many dicks. I’ve heard too much about who’s good at using their small dicks. Who’s actually managed to make a girl cum with oral. Who’s not so good at anything. Who lies about their age. Who likes hentai (oddly, a lot more than you’d think).
            <br><br>
            K so maybe I just know lots about people’s trauma and sex lives-
            <br><br>
            I guess my point with this article is that someone most likely knows something about you that you wish they didn’t. If it’s someone such as myself who won’t blab about it then you’re a small, fortunate minority.
            <br><br>
            Personally, I handle this by owning <i>everything</i>. If you don’t, there will be problems. 90% of the time, if you confidently own the weird shit you did then most people will just accept it as a fine thing to have done.
            <br><br>
